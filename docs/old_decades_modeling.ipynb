    "In this document, we will do prediction modeling for predicting decades. We will use the balance dataset that has been adjusted by generating synthetic data using SMOTE for those underrepresented decades. We will use the following models to predict decades: Logistic regression, SVMs, and Neural Nets. Every model will have hyperparameter tuning. We will evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score."
